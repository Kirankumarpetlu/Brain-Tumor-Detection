# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI scans using a deep learning model based on ResNet-18. It also applies Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to highlight the region of interest in the MRI image where the model is focusing, making the prediction explainable.
